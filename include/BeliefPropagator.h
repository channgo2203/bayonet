/** \class BeliefPropagator
*   \brief Implementation of the belief propagation algorithm.
*
*  
* The BeliefPropagator class permits to use the Kim-Pearl message passing algorithm
* for making exact inferences in a Bayesian network. The Kim-Pearl algorithm uses a set of
* parameters, called pi-values and lambda-values, and a set of messages called
* pi-message and lambda-message, for answering inference queries. 
* This algorithm can be used only if the network is single connected.
* The algorithm is quite complicated, a good description can be found in:
*
* "Bayesian Artificial Intelligence" (Kevin B. Korb and Ann E. Nicholson) chapter 3.
* "Learning Bayesian Networks" (Richard E. Neapolitan) chapter 3.
