/** \class JointProbabilityTable
 *   \brief A table containing the joint probabilities of random variables.
 *
 *  Why a Joint Conditional Table class is important? 
 *
 *  "Most commonly, BNs are considered to be representations of joint probability distri-
 *  butions. There is a fundamental assumption that there is a useful underlying structure
 *  to the problem being modeled that can be captured with a BN, i.e., that not every
 *  node is connected to every other node. If such domain structure exists, a BN gives
 *  a more compact representation than simply describing the probability of every joint
 *  instantiation of all variables. Sparse Bayesian networks (those with relatively few
 *  arcs, which means few parents for each node) represent probability distributions in a
 *  computationally tractable way." 
 *  (Bayesian Artificial Intelligence, Second Edition, 2011)
