/** \class ConditionalProbabilityTable
 *  \brief A table containing the conditional probabilities of random variables.
 *
 * To quantify the relationships between the nodes it is necessary to specify
 * a conditional distribution for each node given its parents. Using discrete
 * random variables the best way to represent such a relationship is the 
 * conditional probability table (CPT). The CPT of a node contains all the
 * possible combinations of values (instantiation) of the parents nodes. For
 * each instantiation it is necessary to specify the probabilities that the 
 * child node assumes given each of its values. 
 * Bayonet store the CPT as a std::map, where the key is a vector of integers
 * representing the states of the parents node, and the value is a vector of 
 * double representing the probabilities of the variable states.
 *
